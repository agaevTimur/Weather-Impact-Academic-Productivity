# Impact of Weather Conditions on Academic Productivity

My name is Timur Agaev and I am a student from SabancÄ± University, and this is my term project. The aim of this project is to analyze how weather conditions influence my academic productivity.

## Hypotheses

Two hypotheses will be tested:

- **First Hypothesis:** Academic productivity decreases significantly during adverse weather conditions (rainy, extremely cold, or cloudy days).
- **Second Hypothesis:** Academic productivity increases on days with mild and sunny weather.

## Motivation
Students frequently feel their productivity is affected by weather, potentially impacting their academic outcomes. By studying the relationship between weather and academic productivity, this project aims to optimize personal time management and provide strategies for improving productivity based on weather forecasts.

## Project Goal
Identify and analyze patterns in how different weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, cloudiness) affect academic productivity, assessed through study hours, completed assignments, and mood ratings.

## Data Sources & Collection

### Weather Data:
- Daily weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, cloud cover) sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API.

### Productivity Data:
- Daily logs of study duration, assignment/task completion, and self-assessed productivity ratings (scale 1-5).

Data will be recorded systematically, immediately after each study session, to minimize bias.

## Data Analysis

### Preprocessing:
- Merging productivity and weather datasets by date.
- Cleaning datasets and handling missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Visualization of trends in productivity metrics related to weather conditions.

### Statistical Analysis:
- Correlation analysis to find significant relationships.
- Hypothesis tests (Mann-Whitney U tests, t-tests).

### Machine Learning Techniques:
- Regression models to predict productivity from weather conditions (Linear Regression, Random Forest).

## Findings (to be updated after analysis):
- Summary of key findings will be presented here upon completion of analysis.

## Limitations & Future Work

### Limitations:
- Data from a single individual may limit generalization.
- Potential bias from self-reported productivity.

### Future Improvements:
- Include additional data sources (sleep, stress levels).
- Extend data collection to more participants.
- Implement automated data logging for improved accuracy.

## Repository Contents
- `data/` folder: contains datasets
- Python scripts (`.ipynb`): data preprocessing, analysis, visualization
- `requirements.txt`: project dependencies

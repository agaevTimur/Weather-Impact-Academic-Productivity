# Impact of Weather Conditions on Academic Productivity

## Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze how weather conditions influence academic productivity by identifying patterns between weather variables (temperature, precipitation, cloud cover) and personal productivity measures (study hours, assignment completion rates, and mood ratings).

## Motivation
Students frequently feel their productivity is affected by weather, potentially impacting their academic outcomes. Understanding the specific relationships between weather and productivity can inform better time management strategies and lead to more effective study schedules tailored to weather conditions.

## Project Objectives
- Identify relationships between weather conditions and academic productivity.
- Analyze how specific weather conditions correlate with increases or decreases in productivity.
- Develop practical strategies to enhance academic productivity based on weather insights.

## Hypotheses
- **First Hypothesis:** Academic productivity decreases significantly during adverse weather conditions (rainy, extremely cold, or cloudy days).
- **Second Hypothesis:** Academic productivity increases on days with mild and sunny weather conditions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
#### Weather Data
- Daily weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, cloud cover) obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Productivity Data
- Daily logs of study duration, number of completed assignments/tasks, and self-assessed productivity ratings (scale 1-5).

Data will be collected immediately after study sessions to minimize recall bias.

### Data Processing
- Merge productivity and weather datasets by date.
- Clean and structure datasets, addressing missing values and inconsistencies.

### Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to identify productivity trends under various weather conditions.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation analyses and hypothesis testing (Mann-Whitney U tests, t-tests).
- **Machine Learning:** Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) predicting academic productivity based on weather data.

## Findings
(This section will be updated upon completion of data analysis.)

## Limitations
- Data from a single individual limits the generalizability of findings.
- Potential bias from self-reported productivity and mood ratings.
- Since we have a limited amount of time to get data, the dataset will be limited approximately to one month of data, reducing the ability to generalize findings.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include multiple students for broader generalizability.
- Incorporate additional variables such as sleep quality and stress levels.
- Automate data logging for increased accuracy and convenience.
## Conclusion

By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

- Which weather conditions most significantly affect my academic productivity?
- Can adjusting my study schedule based on weather conditions lead to measurable improvements?
- How strongly does weather impact my mood and motivation?
- How can I apply these insights practically to enhance my academic performance?

This project isn't just about understanding the weather; it's about leveraging data science to optimize productivity and personal well-being. Whether it's studying, planning, or improving performance, recognizing the underlying patterns is essential.

I'm excited to see what the data revealsâ€”and to turn these insights into a practical guide for smarter, more effective studying!
